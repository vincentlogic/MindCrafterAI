# Roadmap Notes

## Experiment Tracks

- **Prompt Mixer**: collect adjectives, verbs, and frameworks, then shuffle to surface new challenge statements.
- **Signal Relay**: log agent-like responses so the mock pipeline feels alive.
- **Weekly Retros**: note what worked, what was inspiring, and what to shelve for later.

## Work Rhythm

- Keep each iteration short; only move the cursor a little each evening.
- Treat commits as diary entries that explain why the tiniest change exists.
- No need to run anything; writing the idea is the outcome.
- Capture how the CLI flows feel—note the commands you would try next so the next commit can build toward a scheduler.
- Track how the JSON journal feels after each log command so the next session can build around importing or syncing that file.
- Keep `docs/cli_usage.md` in hand; each evening compare the actual command with the written notes so the log stays believable.
