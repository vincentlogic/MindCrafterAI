# Roadmap Notes

## Experiment Tracks

- **Prompt Mixer**: collect adjectives, verbs, and frameworks, then shuffle to surface new challenge statements.
- **Signal Relay**: log agent-like responses so the mock pipeline feels alive.
- **Weekly Retros**: note what worked, what was inspiring, and what to shelve for later.

## Work Rhythm

- Keep each iteration short; only move the cursor a little each evening.
- Treat commits as diary entries that explain why the tiniest change exists.
- No need to run anything; writing the idea is the outcome.
